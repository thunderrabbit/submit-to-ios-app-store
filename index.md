I know I wrote something like this before, but now I cannot find it.   I looked in bitbucket, github gists, but not redmine, which I cannot seem to find now at redmine.robnugen.com.  I also checked in https://new.robnugen.com/toots 

(( below is adapted from https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-submit-an-ios-app-to-the-app-store--mobile-16812 and https://www.raywenderlich.com/184709/submit-app-apple-no-account-app-store-part-1))

I am writing this copy in https://new.robnugen.com/toots/submit-to-iOS-app-store/
and maybe also in
https://wiki.robnugen.com/wiki/Programming:How_to_publish_an_iOS_app_as_of_2018
